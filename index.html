          <p class="title">Resourceful</p>
          <p class="doingsDate">2016</p>
          <p class="doingsDescription">As a university student who's poor, but keen on delicious food, I thought it would
          be very helpful to have an intuitive recipe-searching tool that can give you a best match based on the ingredients
        you already have. And so, for Electric City Hacks 2016, I partnered with two more friends to work on the project. We decided
      that integrating the idea with Amazon Alexa would yield the most benefit, as Alexa is already marketed as a home helper.<br>
      Resourceful's main purpose is to reduce food waste that is caused by the inconsistency in which we buy raw foods, and how much we actually use
      to cook our meals. The program is also able to accomodate a recipe for special needs, such as allergies and nutrition value.</p>

    			<p class="title">Brainiac</p>
    			<p class="doingsDate">2014</p>
    			<p class="doingsDescription">An arcade-style game designed to help international students learn aspects of English, Math, Chemistry,
            and as a bonus - names of peculiar programming languages. It was 'virally' uploaded onto several computers in the school lab and thoroughly
            tested with the help and advice of subject experts (teachers).<br>Brainiac was my first ever project, and it was completed in collaboration with
            a friend in two weeks as a final project for a highschool course. Later on, it was rewritten and refactored using Python.</p>

    			<p class="title">Wandaless</p>
    			<p class="doingsDate">2016</p>
    			<p class="doingsDescription">A project completed and presented for HackHarvard 2016.<br>
          With globalization taking over the world, we often find ourselves having friends located in different corners of the world.
          More often than not, meeting up to have some quality vacation time or simply agreeing on the same itineraries is hectic and requires too much effort.
          Wandaless is designed to close that gap and provide people with a convenient way to plan their adventures.<br>
          Users can connect and chat real-time, set a starting point to meet up, change destination nodes which they want to visit
          during their trip and visualize the entire route on a map.<br>Additionally, Wanda, the responsive chat bot, analyzes chat messages to sense when
          users are suggesting additional destination nodes or asking for a trip review and responds to the requests accordingly.<br>Wandaless was completed in a group
          of four, with my specialization being real-time chat interfaces and AI.</p>

    			<p class="doingsDescription">Being a member of the Engage platform team, I had my first taste of the
            rigorous Agile project lifestyle. The work tempo was especially aggressive, due to the rapid growth and expansion of the company and its products.
            I continuously monitored the system for defects and closely communicated with the CSM department to ensure customer success.
            Additionally, due to the constantly evolving nature of Engage, I was happy to contribute to the re-establishment of the QA Automation Testing code repository.
            <br>As a bonus, I was able to gain insight and mentorship about the infrastructure of the company's software products and how they
