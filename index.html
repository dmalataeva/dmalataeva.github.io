			<p class="title">Brainiac</p>
			<p class="doingsDate">2014</p>
			<p class="doingsDescription" id="project1">An arcade-style game designed to help international students learn aspects of English, Math, Chemistry,
        and as a bonus - names of peculiar programming languages. It was 'virally' uploaded onto several computers in the school lab and thoroughly
        tested with the help and advice of subject experts (teachers).<br>Brainiac was my first ever project, and it was completed in collaboration with
        a friend in two weeks as a final project for a highschool course. Later on, it was rewritten and refactored using Python.</p>
      <p class="doingsTools">Python, prev. SmallBasic</p>

			<p class="title">Wandaless</p>
			<p class="doingsDate">2016</p>
			<p class="doingsDescription" id="project2">A project completed and presented for HackHarvard 2016. The web application lets users collaborate on
      travel plans. Users can connect and chat real-time, set a starting point to meet up, change destination nodes which they want to visit
      during their trip and visualize the entire route on a map.<br>Additionally, Wanda, the responsive chat bot, analyzes chat messages to sense when
      users are suggesting additional destination nodes or asking for a trip review and responds to the requests accordingly.<br>Wandaless was completed in a group
      of four, with my specialization being real-time chat interfaces and AI.</p>
      <p class="doingsTools">Javascript (incl. Ajax, jQuery), Java; Bootstrap, Google Cloud Services, Googlemaps API and Motion.ai</p>

      <p class="doingsTitle">IT Programmer Analyst</p>
			<p class="doingsDescription" id="internship1">Worked on various projects and got to see insight into inter-department
        communication and business customs. I also got to see some very neat security technology in action! Closely customized and scripted Dynamics CRM software, monitored deployment
        sessions and fixed bugs. Contributed to scripting the migration and retrieval of business logic and metadata from
        static values to dynamically changing key-value objects.</p>

        worked on the QA team to test weekly sprint deployments, continuously monitored the system for bugs and closely
        communicated with the CSM department. As a long-term goal for this internship, I worked with a team of developers to
        re-strategize Quality Assurance and automate most of the testing processes.<br>Additionally, I was able to gain
        insight and mentorship about the infrastructure of the company's software products and how they
        compete with industry standards and trends.</p>
